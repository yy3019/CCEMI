\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or a matrix containing the incomplete data. Missing values are coded as NA.}

\item{predM}{A numeric matrix of length(blocks) rows and ncol(data) columns, containing 0/1 data specifying the set of predictors to be used for each target column. Each row corresponds to a variable block, i.e., a set of variables to be imputed. A value of 1 means that the column variable is used as a predictor for the target block (in the rows). The matrix should base on the calibration design you want.}

\item{nCalib}{Row number of calibration data}

\item{nMain}{Row number of Main data}

\item{model}{The model you want to analysis, example: "y ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + z"}

\item{nImp}{Imputation number per boot, normally set as 2.}

\item{nBoot}{Boot number, normally set >=200}

\item{seed}{An integer that is used as argument by the set.seed() for offsetting the random number generator. Default is to leave the random number generator alone.}

\value{
impst: A list of imputed datasets. imp_complete: Complete imputed data. result: Point estimate, ci, variance

\description{
Multiple Imputation of More than One Exposure with Non-differential Measurement Error
}
\details{
Constrained Iterative Conditional Imputation (CICI) treats the true concentrations in the new samples as missing and utilize multiple imputation to fill in these values based on the non-differential measurement error (NDME) assumption.
